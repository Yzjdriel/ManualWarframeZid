## Multiplayer Manual

Your Arsenal is restricted to the non-Prime Warframes that were in the game from Vanilla.
Once you clear a node where the parts for a frame drop from, you have access to that frame.
If the frame is a quest frame (like Mirage or Limbo), you have access to that frame once 
Arsenal unlocks allow you to use that category of object in your loadout.
The 'Prime Frames' unlock allows only the use of Prime version of frames you have access to.
Excalibur Umbra is NOT a Prime Frame - he is unlocked by receiving the 'Post-Sacrifice' item.
Treat the Star Chart as though you are a new account - start at E Prime on Earth and work your way node-by-node.
You cannot advance to the next planet until you have received the Junction Key and cleared the Junction as normal.
Junction Challenges are not in play unless you hate yourself since there's no way to track a lot of that.
Boss nodes require all three Boss Keys to access.
Endless mission nodes require you to obtain the C drop (4 cycles in all nodes except Arbitration, where you need 5) to clear them.
Sanctuary Onslaught requires 8 Zones to clear.
Defeat the Murmur Assassinate mission to Goal the Manual.
