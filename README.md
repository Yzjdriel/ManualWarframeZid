# ManualWarframeZid
A manual APWorld for Warframe.

I haven't decided how evil I want to be yet.
For now, the arsenal is heavily restricted, but otherwise progression is pretty lenient.

## How To Use This Manual

If you're running the async:
1) Download the latest release
2) Drag the .apworld into the custom_worlds folder in your AP installation.
3) You're all set!

If you're playing the slot (and aren't me):
- Instructions aren't currently included in the files; ping me in the AP Discord and I'll run you through the quirks.
